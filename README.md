# React Web Application Project

Technologies used include: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vite, Redux Toolkit, React Bootstrap

Created a React Web Application using the Rick and Morty API to display characters seen throughout the show, locations featured in the show, and each episode of the show available in the API. The site includes navigation via Routes, pagination where relevant, and the option to search for a specific character. Upon clicking for more details of a character, shows information on that character, their last known location, and each episode that character is featured in. Similarly, locations show the residents of that location, and the episodes show which characters were featured in that episode. The site has a light theme and a dark theme which can be toggled in the navbar. In the future could add additional search options (location, episode), and filters for searches (status, species, type, etc).

Unsolved problems:
Sometimes additional characters are displayed on the episode page other than those featured in the episode. Could fix this by checking to make sure all displayed characters are in the list of featured characters.
